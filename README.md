# Attendance-System-for-IIT-Patna

In this project, we have to create a website from where we can download the attendance id card sheet of students of a college.

We have been given two database tables room_allocation and student_info.

room allocation stores the list of roll numbers in each room, for each examination date and shift.
student info contains details of students like roll no, email, etc.

attendance sheet have to created room wise and subject wise.

In course wise , we have sheets for each valid combination of (date, shift, courseID). 
In room wise, we have sheets for each valid combination of (date, shift, roomNo)

by clicking on the corresponding button we get the sheet for that valid combination.
